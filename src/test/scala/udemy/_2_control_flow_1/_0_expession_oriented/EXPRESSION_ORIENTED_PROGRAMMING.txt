0. Scala is expression oriented language

1. Statement vs Expression
--------------------------

"An EXPRESSION has a value; a STATEMENT carries out an action".
                                        Horstmann, "Scala for Impatient."

An EXPRESSION can be right part of an assignment;
a STATEMENT can be string finished with semicolon.
